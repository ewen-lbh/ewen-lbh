Hi! I'm Ewen Le Bihan, interested in almost anything that is both creative and digital.

Started programming with python (which I still love and use extensively) and web programming, now diversifying and learning about lower-level languages (currently Go).

I really like creating:

- frameworks (see [restapiboys](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/restapiboys))
- small and do-one-thing-and-do-it-well packages (see [python-strip-ansi](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/python-strip-ansi))
- web applications, whether 
  - huge (see [schoolsyst](https://github.com/schoolsyst))
  - or small (see [ultisnips-tools](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/utilsnips-tools))
- CLIs with pretty interfaces (see [ideaseed](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ideaseed))

I work on a lot of projects and also do [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6tUc6r8aNeiiT1mElcnMx9?si=ezLedPQ4Qimkep9xmsjpQA) and [graphism/motion design](https://ewen.works) on top of that, and some small papers/books (not published yet because it's the rough beginnings!)
