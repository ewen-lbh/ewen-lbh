Hi! I'm Ewen Le Bihan, interested in almost anything that is both creative and digital.

Started programming with python (which I still love and use extensively) and web programming, now diversifying and learning about lower-level languages (currently Go).

I really like creating:

- web applications, whether 
  - huge (see [schoolsyst](https://github.com/schoolsyst))
  - or small (see [ultisnips-tools](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ultisnips-tools))
- CLIs with pretty interfaces (see [ideaseed](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ideaseed))
- small and [do-one-thing-and-do-it-well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#origin) packages (see [python-strip-ansi](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/python-strip-ansi))

I work on a lot of projects and also do [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6tUc6r8aNeiiT1mElcnMx9?si=ezLedPQ4Qimkep9xmsjpQA) and [graphism/motion design](https://ewen.works) on top of that, and some small papers/books (not published yet because it's the rough beginnings!)

I like minimalism, so my website's domain name is just [ewen.works](https://ewen.works) <sub>accessing the `works` array on the `ewen` object ;)</sub>

I started publishing some art stuff [on RedBubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/ewenlbh/shop) as well.

I'm currently studying maths in higher education to earn access to highly selective engineering schools called "Grandes Ã‰coles", here's a nice theorem for you :)

$$
\forall N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall u \in \mathcal{L}(E), \forall (P_i)_{1\leq i \leq N} \in \mathbb{K}[X]^N, 
$$

$$
\bigwedge_{i=1}^N P_i = 1 \implies \ker \left(\prod_{i=1}^N P_i\right)(u) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^N \ker P_i(u)
$$
